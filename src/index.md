## Currently Exploring

### Modelling Exercises

Modelling exercises serve as a way to practice and develop techniques that will hopefully be applicable to large production applications.

[Backlog Modelling Exercise](./backlog-modelling-exercise.md)

- [Statechart solution](./modelling-a-backlog-app-with-statecharts.md)

### Complexity Metrics

Imagine a world where you could say "I'm building x app which has 8/10 interactive complexity, 5/10 data flow complexity..."

### Statecharts

- Where are all the little statecharts?
- The Clustering Problem

### Eventcharts

A novel notation to overcome the problems with statecharts at scale.

Motivation - [A DSL for Events](./a-dsl-for-events.md)

### The History of Reactive Programming

- Synchronous Languages - Esterel, Lustre, Signal

### What Do We Mean?

Commonly-used terms without a common definition

- Business Logic
- Separation of Concerns
- Declarative Code

### Misc

- Does the Clustering Problem appear in other areas?
- Can we remove double reactivity from GUIs?
